# Anderson Darling test for Laplace distribution

This Anderson-Darling test for Laplacian distribution assumes that 
we do not know the location and scale parameters of the original distribution.  

Null hypothesis: The sample data is drawn from a Laplacian distribution.  
If result Anderson Statistic is larger than the critical value, 
the null hypothesis is rejected at the corresponding significance level.
